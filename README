Below describes the files contained within ywang/work/E17andPN15
* could refer to E17 or PN15

###############################################
Fastq files that had the corrected quality scores:
*_new.fq
Sam files of all the reads, converted from fastq files using Bowtie Aligner
*.sam
Bam files and indexed bam files, converted from sam files using Samtools
*.bam
*.bam.bai

###############################################
Number of times the sequences (defined by *.bam files) fall within the defined upstream and downstream region of the gene
*_count.txt
Like previous, without considering Chr?_rand entries
*_count_norand.txt

###############################################
Gff files converted from *.sam with 'more *.sam | python -m hiseq.sam2gff  > *.gff
*.gff
GeneTrack files converted from *.gff with 'python -m hiseq.tabs2genetrack' (use -s *SHIFT option)
*.tab (unshifted)
E17-shift35-peaks-5.00.gff -> Peaks-sigma-50.0-width-70-E17-shift35.txt.gff (shifted by 35 in 5' direction, peaks with value > 5.00 only)
PN15-shift37-peaks-2.00.gff -> Peaks-sigma-50.0-width-74-PN15-shift37.txt.gff (shited by 37 in 5' direction, peaks with value > 3.00 only)
Peaks files created by GeneTrack
Any file beginning with Peaks*

###############################################
Peaks Files
GeneTrack files
E17-shift35-peaks-all.txt -> Peaks-sigma-50.0-width-70-E17-shift35.txt.txt (shifted by 35 in 5' direction, all peaks, strand composite)
PN15-shift37-peaks-all.txt -> Peaks-sigma-50.0-width-74-PN15-shift37.txt.txt (shifted by 37 in 5' direction, all peaks, strand composite)
Gff files, converted from GeneTrack Peak Files with 'python -m gtrack.misc.peaks2gff *.txt > *.gff'
E17-shift35-peaks-5.00.gff -> Peaks-sigma-50.0-width-70-E17-shift35.txt.gff (shifted by 35 in 5' direction, peaks with value > 5.00 only, strand composite)
PN15-shift37-peaks-2.00.gff -> Peaks-sigma-50.0-width-74-PN15-shift37.txt.gff (shited by 37 in 5' direction, peaks with value > 3.00 only, strand composite)
Bam files, converted to sam from gff with BamToBed (for -g option, use /export/tools/src/BEDTools-Version-2.12.0/genomes/mouse.mm9.genome), then to bam and indexed bam with Samtools
*-peaks.bam
*-peaks.bam.bai

###############################################
Results:
*-peak-descrpt.txt (lists all peaks around defined interval around each gene's TSS)
*-peak-descrpt-annot.txt (like above, but in addition to RefSeq ID also has Gene Symbol, DAVID annotation)
*-david-gene-cluster.txt (DAVID Gene Functional Annotation Cluster output)

E17-PN15-report-final.doc (summarizes all the methods and results)
